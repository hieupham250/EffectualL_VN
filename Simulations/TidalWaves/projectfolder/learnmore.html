            <h2>What Are Tides?</h2>
            <p>
                Tides are the regular rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon
                and the Sun, along with Earth's rotation. These forces create bulges in Earth's oceans, leading to high
                and low tides.

            <h2>Types of Tides</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Tide:</strong> The point at which the water reaches its highest level.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Tide:</strong> The point at which the water reaches its lowest level.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring Tide:</strong> Occurs when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned, leading to higher
                    high tides and lower low tides.</li>
                <li><strong>Neap Tide:</strong> Occurs when the Sun and Moon are at right angles relative to Earth,
                    resulting in less extreme tides.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Do Tides Matter?</h2>
            <p>
                Tides influence various aspects of life, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marine Life:</strong> Many marine species rely on tides for feeding and reproduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal Activities:</strong> Fishing, boating, and beach activities are affected by tidal
                    patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal Erosion:</strong> The movement of tides contributes to the shaping of coastlines.
                </li>
